Copper Mining Equipment in Chile

<p>As a coastal country located in the southwest region of South America, Chile is the world's largest producer of copper, constituting 28 percent of the world's reserves. The Chilean economy is also very dependent on copper, and this industry employs about 6 percent of the Chilean workforce. Major external investment in Chilean copper mining and the many industries across the world that require copper indicate that this sector will continue to play an important role in Chile's economy. Due to the strong support from Chilean government, there is a boom for copper mining in Chile. However, there are few companies which can supply whole set of copper mining equipment in Chile, but the demand for copper mining equipment significantly increases, so more and more local businessmen choose to import sets of copper production line from China. Here we focus on our copper mining equipment used in Chile.</p>

<h2>Project Study</h2>

<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>Chile
<p><strong>Customer: </strong></p>a Chinese businessman who invests the copper mining in Chile
<p><strong>Application: </strong></p>The Chinese businessman wants to buy a whole set of copper processing line from Zenith for his copper quarry. He would love to install a small scale copping processing line.
<p><strong>Project Name:</strong></p>Small-scale copper mining equipment in Chile

<h2>Design From Zenith's Mining Engineers</h2>

<p>During the process of copper mining, the machines include the crushers, grinding mills, beneficiation equipment, and other associated facilities, such as the vibrating feeder, vibrating screen and belt conveyor. Typically, copper crushers include jaw crushers, impact crusher and cone crushers. In the copper processing, the jaw crushers are used in the coarse crushing, and cone crushers are used in the secondary and fine crushing. As for grinding the copper particles, Zenith engineers suggest using our MTW series trapezium mill, which is very suitable for small-scale production line. We suggest using spiral classifier in the process of copper beneficiation, because spiral classifier can save more energy, which is very suitable for small-scale copper mining.</p>

<h2>Outcome of Project</h2>

<p>This small scale copper processing line in Chile was installed in 2010, up to now it has been running for 2 years, however, it still functions well. We feel it a great honor to help our customers realize his mining dream.
